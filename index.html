                    Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class
                    of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing
                    cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile
                    (FIA). The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula
                    One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of
                    racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word
                    formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants'
                    cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races,
                    known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built
                    circuits and closed public roads.

                    The season brought an end to the championship domination of Mercedes in the V6 turbo-hybrid era
                    (which started in 2014) as Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing-Honda won the Drivers' Championship for the
                    first time in his career. Verstappen became the first ever Dutch driver, the first Honda-powered driver
                    since Ayrton Senna in 1991, the first Red Bull driver since Sebastian Vettel in 2013 and the first
                    non-Mercedes driver in the turbo-hybrid era to win the World Championship.
                    Four-time defending and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes finished runner-up.
                    Mercedes retained the Constructors' Championship for the eighth consecutive season.<br>
